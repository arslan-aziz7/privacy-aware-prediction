Privacy-aware prediction using a modified Lasso

We propose a new methodology that balances the trade-off between how informative a variable is with how privacy-intrusive it is perceived to be by consumers. We do this by modifying the model selection method Lasso, an L1-regularization method. Instead of applying equal penalty weights for each variable included in the model, we weight the penalties in proportion to how privacy-intrusive the variable is perceived to be by consumers.
